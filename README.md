Hey 👋

I'm a technology enthusiast living in Los Angeles. I currently work as a Software Engineering Manager at @brexhq and am responsible for the web experiences team.


I spend my free time 🔧 building software and hardware pet projects, 🛹 e-skateboarding around and 🥁 playing the drums.

## Things I deeply care about

- Good user experience design 🎨
- Good software architecture ⚙️
- People (and customers!) 👨‍
- Shipping products 🚢
